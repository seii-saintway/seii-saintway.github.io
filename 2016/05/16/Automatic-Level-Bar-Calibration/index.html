<p><strong>A Real-time Automatic Level Bar Calibration Based on Canny Edge Detection and Weighted Least Squares Method</strong></p>
<p>The level bar is a common tool for measuring small angle, and it is often used in the construction, machinery and instrument manufacturing industry. Accordance to different working principles, the level bar is divided into bubble level, electronic level and laser level. The bubble level is the most widely used traditional level bar, which determines the horizontality of a plane by the bubble deviation. The electronic level includes inductive level and capacitive level: the inductive level determines whether a plane is level by the voltage change of the induction coil, while the capacitive level by the capacitance of interstices on both ends. The laser level leads the beam of the laser emission to telescope tube, making it beam through the collimation axis, if the beam isn’t blocked, the plane is level. The level bar in this paper is one kind of bubble level.<br>Before leaving the factory, the level bar needs to be calibrated, namely to put the level bar on the standard horizontal plane, to find the bubble deviation from the center of the level bar to check the measurement accuracy of the product. In China, the detection is mainly depended on the human eye judgment which is slow, erroneous and instable. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel method capable of accurate calibration of the level bar to improve the precision of the product.</p>
<p>The bubble in the level bars formed from the remaining air by filling the cylindrical cavity 4&#x2F;5 green oily liquid. A calibration algorithm based on optimal thresholding was proposed by Wei Yu [1-2]. In this paper, we present a realization of automatic and real-time detection of level bar based on Canny edge detection and weighted least squares method. In order to reduce the effects of light changes on detection accuracy, we introduce a method to adaptively set the thresholds of the Canny Edge Detection. A faster contour tracing algorithm based on binary search is employed. Experimental results show that this solution is feasible.</p>
<p>The bubble of the level bars sealed in a glass column, and it will reflect strong light and disturb the identification of bubble edge and the whole image recognizing process if we direct light the bubble or light it in a wrong angle. Considering that the bubble and the glass column are transparent, the background is required to be flat and uniform. Since the upper surface of the bubble of the level bar is convex, if taking the image from the top of the level bar, there is always a mirror reflection effect, so that the quality of the image deteriorates and will impact the effect of subsequent detection algorithm. So we decide to take the image from the side of the level bar. A CCD camera is used as an image sensor in this application.</p>

MainFrm.cpp


This code appears to be an implementation of the `CMainFrame` class for a Windows application. The class inherits from `CFrameWnd` and has message handlers for various events, such as `WM_CREATE`, `WM_SHOWWINDOW`, and `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED`. The class also has member functions for snapping a picture (`Snap`) and locating an object in the image (`Locate`).

The `Snap` function retrieves a frame from a camera and stores it in a buffer (`pImage`). The buffer is assumed to be a grayscale image with dimensions of `HEIGHT` x `WIDTH`.

The `Locate` function locates an object in the image using an algorithm that calculates the intensity of each row of pixels within a rectangular region of interest (`pDoc-&gt;m_rtAperture`). The algorithm calculates the gradient of the intensity curve and locates the peak of the gradient to determine the position of the object.

The code also includes a `Counter` class that measures the time it takes to execute a block of code and updates the response time of the application.


MainFrm.h


This appears to be a C++ header file named &#34;MainFrm.h&#34; which defines the interface for the CMainFrame class. It includes several other header files, such as &#34;ResultDialog.h&#34;, &#34;ConfigDialog.h&#34;, &#34;AdminDialog.h&#34;, &#34;ManuDialog.h&#34;, &#34;AutoDialog.h&#34;, as well as &#34;pylon/PylonIncludes.h&#34; and &#34;pylon/PylonGUI.h&#34;. The namespace Pylon is also used.

The CMainFrame class inherits from the CFrameWnd class and includes a protected member variable named &#34;camera&#34; of type CInstantCamera. The class also includes several member functions, including Snap(), which takes no arguments and returns void, and Locate(), which takes no arguments and returns a BOOL. The class overrides several virtual functions and defines several message map functions.

Additional metadata for the file is provided, including the file path, name, and type.


ManuDialog.cpp


This is a C++ implementation file named &#34;ManuDialog.cpp&#34;. It includes several headers including &#34;stdafx.h&#34;, &#34;sptx.h&#34;, and &#34;ManuDialog.h&#34;. 

The class &#34;CManuDialog&#34; is implemented in this file. It inherits from the &#34;CDialog&#34; class and is dynamically created using the &#34;IMPLEMENT_DYNCREATE&#34; macro. The constructor initializes the base class and the destructor does nothing. The &#34;DoDataExchange&#34; function is responsible for exchanging data between the dialog box controls and the class data members. The message map is empty, which means that there are no message handlers defined for this class.

There are some debugging macros defined for this class, including &#34;new DEBUG_NEW&#34; and &#34;THIS_FILE&#34;. There are also some diagnostic functions defined for this class in case of debugging.

SPTX.sln


This is a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file in version 10.00 format, created for Visual Studio 2008. It includes one project named &#34;SPTX&#34; with a project ID of &#34;{7E7CC27F-8FD6-4CC1-9A12-90E516CADEE7}&#34;, stored in a file named &#34;SPTX.vcproj&#34;. 

The file also contains three global sections: SolutionConfigurationPlatforms, ProjectConfigurationPlatforms, and SolutionProperties. The first section specifies the available configuration platforms, which are &#34;Debug|Win32&#34; and &#34;Release|Win32&#34;. The second section maps each configuration platform to the appropriate project configuration. The third section specifies that the solution node should not be hidden.


SPTX.vcproj


This looks like an XML file for a Visual Studio project. What kind of project is this?


SPTXDoc.cpp


This appears to be a C++ source code file that defines the implementation of the CSPTXDoc class, which is a document class for an application called SPTX. The file includes several header files, including &#34;stdafx.h&#34;, which is typically used to include standard system headers that are used frequently but are unlikely to change. 

The CSPTXDoc class inherits from the CDocument class and defines several member variables and functions. The member variables include various properties such as m_bLining and m_bBoxing, which appear to be boolean values indicating whether certain features are enabled or not, and various numerical values such as m_fDeviation and m_nResponseTime. There are also several CPoint objects which define start and end points for some kind of drawing operation, and several other objects such as m_arrMM which appears to be some kind of array or list of float values.

The class also defines several member functions, including a constructor and destructor, an OnNewDocument() function, and a Serialize() function. The OnNewDocument() function appears to reset the member variables to some default values, while the Serialize() function is used to read or write the document&#39;s data to or from a file. There are also several message map entries which define how the application should respond to certain events, although these appear to be empty in this particular file.


SPTXDoc.h


This appears to be the contents of a C++ header file named &#34;SPTXDoc.h&#34;. The file defines a class called &#34;CSPTXDoc&#34; which inherits from the &#34;CDocument&#34; class. The class has several member variables, including some floating point values, integers, and a few MFC-specific types like &#34;CPoint&#34; and &#34;CRect&#34;. The class also has several member functions, including overrides for the &#34;OnNewDocument&#34; and &#34;Serialize&#34; functions. There are also two external variables declared at the bottom of the file: a pointer to a byte and a pointer to a &#34;CSPTXDoc&#34; object. The metadata indicates that this file is located at &#34;SPTXDoc.h&#34;, has a file name of &#34;SPTXDoc.h&#34;, and is a header file with a &#34;.h&#34; extension.


SPTXView.cpp


This code is an implementation of a C++ class called `CSPTXView`. It includes the following functionalities:

- Drawing a bitmap image on the view.
- Creating a window with a specific size and class.
- Registering a new window class.
- Handling mouse and window events.
- Deleting the bitmap image and freeing up memory.

The `CSPTXView` constructor initializes the bitmap image by allocating memory for a `BITMAPINFO` structure and sets its properties. It also initializes a flag `m_bDrawing` to `FALSE`.

The `PreCreateWindow` function is called before creating the window and registers a new window class. It also sets the size of the window.

The `OnDraw` function is called to draw the bitmap image on the view. It first creates a memory device context (`m_dcMemory`) and fills it with a white color. It then uses `SetDIBitsToDevice` to display the bitmap image on the device context. If a flag `m_bBoxing` is set to `TRUE`, it draws a rectangle on the memory device context. Similarly, if a flag `m_bLining` is set to `TRUE`, it draws a line on the memory device context.

The class also handles various window events such as `WM_CREATE`, `WM_DESTROY`, `WM_SIZE`, `WM_MOUSEWHEEL`, `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`, `WM_LBUTTONUP`, and `WM_MOUSEMOVE`.


SPTXView.h


This is a C++ header file called &#34;SPTXView.h&#34; that defines the interface of the &#34;CSPTXView&#34; class. The class appears to inherit from the &#34;CView&#34; class. The header file defines a number of member variables and member functions for the &#34;CSPTXView&#34; class, including &#34;GetDocument()&#34;, &#34;OnDraw()&#34;, &#34;PreCreateWindow()&#34;, &#34;OnInitialUpdate()&#34;, &#34;OnCreate()&#34;, &#34;OnDestroy()&#34;, &#34;OnSize()&#34;, &#34;OnMouseWheel()&#34;, &#34;OnLButtonDown()&#34;, &#34;OnLButtonUp()&#34;, and &#34;OnMouseMove()&#34;. 

The member variables include &#34;m_pbmi&#34;, &#34;m_dcMemory&#34;, &#34;m_bm&#34;, &#34;m_nWidth&#34;, &#34;m_nHeight&#34;, and &#34;m_bDrawing&#34;. &#34;m_pbmi&#34; appears to be a pointer to a BITMAPINFO struct, &#34;m_dcMemory&#34; is a device context for a memory device, &#34;m_bm&#34; is a bitmap object, &#34;m_nWidth&#34; and &#34;m_nHeight&#34; are integers that represent the width and height of the view, respectively, and &#34;m_bDrawing&#34; is a boolean that represents whether or not the view is currently being drawn.

The member functions are mostly event handlers that respond to user input, such as clicking, resizing, and moving the mouse. The &#34;OnDraw()&#34; function is called to draw the view, and the &#34;GetDocument()&#34; function is used to retrieve a pointer to the associated document.


StdAfx.cpp


This file is a source file named &#34;StdAfx.cpp&#34; and it includes the standard includes. It seems like it is part of a larger project named &#34;SPTX&#34;. The file itself doesn&#39;t seem to contain any additional code beyond the standard includes.


StdAfx.h


This is a C++ header file called &#34;stdafx.h&#34; which is commonly used in Microsoft Visual C++ projects. It includes standard system include files and project-specific include files that are frequently used but changed infrequently. 

The header file contains preprocessor directives and macros to define the header file&#39;s inclusion guards, to exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers, and to include necessary MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) components.

The header file also has a Microsoft-specific directive to insert additional declarations immediately before the previous line.


SPTX.rc2


This is the content of a resource file named &#34;SPTX.rc2&#34; located in the &#34;res&#34; folder. The file contains comments indicating that it should not be edited directly by Microsoft Visual C++. It also contains a section where manually edited resources can be added.

SPTX.rc


This is a text file containing resource script code for a Microsoft Windows application. The file extension &#34;.rc&#34; stands for &#34;resource script&#34;. The resource script is used to define the resources that will be compiled into the application, such as dialog boxes, icons, menus, and strings.

The file starts with some #define statements, which are preprocessor directives used to define constants. These constants are used throughout the script to give meaningful names to various resources.

After the #define statements, the script defines several dialogs (IDD_CONFIGURATION, IDD_RESULT, IDD_MANU, and IDD_AUTO) and specifies their properties such as margins and guides.

The script also defines a few string tables, which are used to define string resources that will be displayed in the application. These string resources include menu item names, dialog box titles, and status bar messages.

The metadata at the end of the code provides information about the file, including its path, name, and type.

<p>This looks like an XML file for a Visual Studio project. What kind of project is this?</p>
<p>SPTXDoc.cpp</p>
<p>This appears to be a C++ source code file that defines the implementation of the CSPTXDoc class, which is a document class for an application called SPTX. The file includes several header files, including &quot;stdafx.h&quot;, which is typically used to include standard system headers that are used frequently but are unlikely to change.</p>
<p>The CSPTXDoc class inherits from the CDocument class and defines several member variables and functions. The member variables include various properties such as m_bLining and m_bBoxing, which appear to be boolean values indicating whether certain features are enabled or not, and various numerical values such as m_fDeviation and m_nResponseTime. There are also several CPoint objects which define start and end points for some kind of drawing operation, and several other objects such as m_arrMM which appears to be some kind of array or list of float values.</p>
<p>The class also defines several member functions, including a constructor and destructor, an OnNewDocument() function, and a Serialize() function. The OnNewDocument() function appears to reset the member variables to some default values, while the Serialize() function is used to read or write the document's data to or from a file. There are also several message map entries which define how the application should respond to certain events, although these appear to be empty in this particular file.</p>
<p>SPTXDoc.h</p>
<p>This appears to be the contents of a C++ header file named &quot;SPTXDoc.h&quot;. The file defines a class called &quot;CSPTXDoc&quot; which inherits from the &quot;CDocument&quot; class. The class has several member variables, including some floating point values, integers, and a few MFC-specific types like &quot;CPoint&quot; and &quot;CRect&quot;. The class also has several member functions, including overrides for the &quot;OnNewDocument&quot; and &quot;Serialize&quot; functions. There are also two external variables declared at the bottom of the file: a pointer to a byte and a pointer to a &quot;CSPTXDoc&quot; object. The metadata indicates that this file is located at &quot;SPTXDoc.h&quot;, has a file name of &quot;SPTXDoc.h&quot;, and is a header file with a &quot;.h&quot; extension.</p>
<p>SPTXView.cpp</p>
<p>This code is an implementation of a C++ class called <code>CSPTXView</code>. It includes the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing a bitmap image on the view.</li>
<li>Creating a window with a specific size and class.</li>
<li>Registering a new window class.</li>
<li>Handling mouse and window events.</li>
<li>Deleting the bitmap image and freeing up memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>CSPTXView</code> constructor initializes the bitmap image by allocating memory for a <code>BITMAPINFO</code> structure and sets its properties. It also initializes a flag <code>m_bDrawing</code> to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>PreCreateWindow</code> function is called before creating the window and registers a new window class. It also sets the size of the window.</p>
<p>The <code>OnDraw</code> function is called to draw the bitmap image on the view. It first creates a memory device context (<code>m_dcMemory</code>) and fills it with a white color. It then uses <code>SetDIBitsToDevice</code> to display the bitmap image on the device context. If a flag <code>m_bBoxing</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, it draws a rectangle on the memory device context. Similarly, if a flag <code>m_bLining</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, it draws a line on the memory device context.</p>
<p>The class also handles various window events such as <code>WM_CREATE</code>, <code>WM_DESTROY</code>, <code>WM_SIZE</code>, <code>WM_MOUSEWHEEL</code>, <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code>, <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code>, and <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code>.</p>
<p>SPTXView.h</p>
<p>This is a C++ header file called &quot;SPTXView.h&quot; that defines the interface of the &quot;CSPTXView&quot; class. The class appears to inherit from the &quot;CView&quot; class. The header file defines a number of member variables and member functions for the &quot;CSPTXView&quot; class, including &quot;GetDocument()&quot;, &quot;OnDraw()&quot;, &quot;PreCreateWindow()&quot;, &quot;OnInitialUpdate()&quot;, &quot;OnCreate()&quot;, &quot;OnDestroy()&quot;, &quot;OnSize()&quot;, &quot;OnMouseWheel()&quot;, &quot;OnLButtonDown()&quot;, &quot;OnLButtonUp()&quot;, and &quot;OnMouseMove()&quot;.</p>
<p>The member variables include &quot;m_pbmi&quot;, &quot;m_dcMemory&quot;, &quot;m_bm&quot;, &quot;m_nWidth&quot;, &quot;m_nHeight&quot;, and &quot;m_bDrawing&quot;. &quot;m_pbmi&quot; appears to be a pointer to a BITMAPINFO struct, &quot;m_dcMemory&quot; is a device context for a memory device, &quot;m_bm&quot; is a bitmap object, &quot;m_nWidth&quot; and &quot;m_nHeight&quot; are integers that represent the width and height of the view, respectively, and &quot;m_bDrawing&quot; is a boolean that represents whether or not the view is currently being drawn.</p>
<p>The member functions are mostly event handlers that respond to user input, such as clicking, resizing, and moving the mouse. The &quot;OnDraw()&quot; function is called to draw the view, and the &quot;GetDocument()&quot; function is used to retrieve a pointer to the associated document.</p>
<p>StdAfx.cpp</p>
<p>This file is a source file named &quot;StdAfx.cpp&quot; and it includes the standard includes. It seems like it is part of a larger project named &quot;SPTX&quot;. The file itself doesn't seem to contain any additional code beyond the standard includes.</p>
<p>StdAfx.h</p>
<p>This is a C++ header file called &quot;stdafx.h&quot; which is commonly used in Microsoft Visual C++ projects. It includes standard system include files and project-specific include files that are frequently used but changed infrequently.</p>
<p>The header file contains preprocessor directives and macros to define the header file's inclusion guards, to exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers, and to include necessary MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) components.</p>
<p>The header file also has a Microsoft-specific directive to insert additional declarations immediately before the previous line.</p>
<p>SPTX.rc2</p>
<p>This is the content of a resource file named &quot;SPTX.rc2&quot; located in the &quot;res&quot; folder. The file contains comments indicating that it should not be edited directly by Microsoft Visual C++. It also contains a section where manually edited resources can be added.</p>
