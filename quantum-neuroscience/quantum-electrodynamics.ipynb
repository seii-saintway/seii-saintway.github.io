    "Relativistic Quantum Field Theory is a mathematical scheme to describe the sub-atomic particles and forces. The basic starting point is that the axioms of Special Relativity on the one hand and those of Quantum Mechanics on the other, should be combined into one theory. The fundamental ingredients for this construction are reviewed. A remarkable feature is that the construction is not perfect; it will not allow us to compute all amplitudes with unlimited precision. Yet in practice this theory is more than accurate enough to cover the entire domain between the atomic scale and the Planck scale, some 20 orders of magnitude."

    "### 1. Introduction to the notion of quantized ﬁelds\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Field Theory is one of those cherished scientiﬁc achievements that have become considerably more successful than they should have, if one takes into consideration the apparently shaky logic on which it is based. With awesome accuracy, all known subatomic particles appear to obey the rules of one example of a quantum ﬁeld theory that goes under the uninspiring name of “The Standard Model”. The creators of this model had hardly anticipated such a success, and one can rightfully ask to what it can be attributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have long been aware of the fact that, in spite of its successes, the Standard Model cannot be exactly right. Most quantum ﬁeld theories are not asymptotically free, which means that they cannot be extended to arbitrarily small distance scales. We could easily cure the Standard Model, but this would not improve our understanding at all, because we know that, at those extremely tiny distance scales where the problems would become relevant, a force appears that we cannot yet describe unambiguously: the gravitational force. It would have to be understood ﬁrst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps this is the real strength of Quantum Field Theory: we know where its limits are, and these limits are far away. The gravitational force acting between two subatomic particles is tremendously weak. As long as we disregard that, the theory is perfect. And, as I will explain, its internal logic is not shaky at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subatomic particles all live in the domain of physics where spins and actions are comparable to Planck’s constant $\\hbar$. One obviously needs Quantum Mechanics to describe them. Since the energies available in sub-atomic interactions are comparable to, and often larger than, the rest mass energy $mc^2$ of these particles, they often travel with velocities close to that of light, $c$, and so relativistic eﬀects will also be important. Thus, in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, the question was asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "“How should one reconcile Quantum Mechanics with Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity? ”\n",
    "\n",
    "As we shall explain, Quantum Field Theory is the answer to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first intuitions would be, and indeed were, quite different [1]. One would set up abstract Hilbert spaces of states, each containing fixed or variable numbers of particles. Subsequently, one would postulate a consistent scheme of interactions. What would ‘consistent’ mean? In Quantum Mechanics, we have learned how to describe a process where we start with a certain number of particles that are all far apart but moving towards one another. This is the ‘in’ state $| \\psi \\rangle_{\\text{in}}$. After the interaction has taken place, we end up with particles all moving away from one another, a state $| \\psi' \\rangle_{\\text{out}}$. The probability that a certain in-state evolves into a given out-state is described by a quantum mechanical transition amplitude, $_{\\text{out}}\\langle \\psi' | \\psi \\rangle_{\\text{in}}$. The set of all such amplitudes in the vector spaces formed by all in- and out-states is called the scattering matrix. One can ask how to construct the scattering matrix in such a way that (i) it is invariant under Lorentz transformations, and (ii) obeys the strict laws of quantum causality. By ‘quantum causality’ we mean that under no circumstance a measurable effect may proceed with a velocity faster than that of light. In practice, this means that one must demand that any set of local operators $O_i(x, t)$ obeys commutation rules such that the commutators $[O_i(x, t), O_j(x', t')]$ vanish as soon as the vector $(x - x', t - t')$ is space-like. One can show that this implies that the scattering matrix must obey dispersion relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indeed how physicists started to think about their problem. But how should one construct such a scattering matrix? Does any systematic procedure exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantized ﬁeld may seem to be something altogether diﬀerent, yet it does appear to allow for the construction of an interacting medium that does obey the laws of Lorentz invariance and causality. The local operators can be constructed from the ﬁelds. All we then have to do is to set up schemes of relativistically covariant ﬁeld equations, such as Maxwell’s laws. Even the introduction of non-linear terms in these equations appears to be straightforward, and if we were to subject such systems to a mathematically welldeﬁned procedure called “quantization”, we would have candidates for a solution to the aforementioned problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing that the energy in a quantized ﬁeld comes in quantized energy packages, which in all respects behave like elementary particles, and, conversely, realizing that operators in the form of ﬁelds could be deﬁned also when one starts up with Hilbert spaces consisting of elementary particles, it was discovered that quantized ﬁelds do indeed describe subatomic particles. Subsequently, it was discovered that, in a quantized ﬁeld, the number of ways in which interactions can be introduced (basically by adding non-linear terms in the ﬁeld equations), is quite limited. Quantization requires that all interactions can be given in the form of a Lagrange function L; relativity requires this L to be Lorentzinvariant, and, most strikingly, self-consistency of Quantum Field Theory then provides further restrictions, which leads to the possibility of writing down a complete list of all possible interactions. The Standard Model is just one element of this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this concise treatise on Quantum Field Theory is too limited to admit detailed descriptions of all technical details. Instead, special emphasis is put on the conceptual issues that arise when addressing the numerous questions and problems associated with this doctrine. One could use this text to learn Quantum Field Theory, but for many technical details, more literature must be consulted.[2] We also limited ourselves to applications of Quantum Field Theory in elementary particle physics. There are many examples in low-temperature physics where these and similar techniques are useful, but they will not be addressed here."

    "where $ V_{\\text{RQED}}^I $ is the interaction in the interaction picture. To compute the probability that a system evolves from some initial state $ |\\alpha\\rangle $ to a final state $ |\\beta\\rangle $, one needs to compute the scattering matrix element $ \\langle \\alpha | S | \\beta \\rangle $. Let us consider Compton scattering, i.e. collision of one electron and one photon. The probability of a transition $ \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta $ (collision cross section $ \\sigma $) satisfies\n",

    "\n",
    "$ \\langle \\alpha | S | \\beta \\rangle $ can be computed as a power series in the coupling constant $ e $ and the resulting expressions can be depicted as Feynman diagrams which capture the intuitive meaning of the respective contributions. The leading contribution is given by a tree diagram (TREE DIAGRAM). Further contributions involve emission and reabsorption of virtual photons (RADIATIVE CORRECTION DIAGRAM). These contributions have the so-called infrared divergences, that is divergences at small values of the photon energy. These divergences can be traced back to the vanishing mass of the photon and integration over the whole space in (0.2). They have to be regularized by introducing an infrared cut-off $ \\lambda > 0 $ (simply eliminating photons of energy smaller than $ \\lambda $). The resulting $ S $-matrix element $ \\langle \\alpha | S_{\\lambda} | \\beta \\rangle $ can be computed, but $ \\lim_{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\langle \\alpha | S_{\\lambda} | \\beta \\rangle = 0 $ as if there was no scattering. Thus standard rules of Quantum Mechanics give an experimentally unacceptable result: $ \\sigma = 0 $! This is one manifestation of the infrared problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way out, proposed by Yennie, Frautschi, and Suura [3] is a serious deviation from these rules of the game. We should not consider the process $ \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta $ alone, but a whole family of processes $ \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta_n $, where $ \\beta_n $ involves emission of $ n $ photons of total energy $ E_t $ in addition to particles present in $ \\beta $.

A mathematically rigorous derivation of this formula from first principles has not been achieved in the perturbative framework of relativistic QED, in spite of many attempts [2]. In contrast, in the framework of non-relativistic QED, there has been steady progress in understanding of the infrared problem. Important advantage: availability of a Hamiltonian as a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space (and not just a formal power series).\n",

    "The problem of relaxation of a Hydrogen atom to the ground state is also difficult to study in the perturbative setting of relativistic QED, because an electron confined in an atom cannot be considered a small perturbation of a freely moving electron."
