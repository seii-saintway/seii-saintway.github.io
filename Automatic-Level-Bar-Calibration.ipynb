    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `CMainFrame::Locate` is a private function that locates the target from the image captured by the camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the function calculates some parameters based on preset thresholds and the aperture area set in `pDoc->m_rtAperture`, and then processes the image to find the center position of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the function first converts the image data in `pImage` into grayscale and calculates the minimum and maximum grayscale values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each row of grayscale values, the function calculates the mean and normalizes it. The relative position of the grayscale value in the image is then determined based on the normalized grayscale value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the function calculates the change in grayscale value `dI` for each row using first-order differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the detected edges `iU1` and `iU2`, the function determines if the location is successful based on the preset thresholds `thY` and `thD`. If `iU2 - iU1` is greater than `thY` and there exists a grayscale value change greater than `thD` in the edge region, the location is considered successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns the location result `pDoc->m_bSuccess`.\n",
    "\n",
